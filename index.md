The **links in the header** show the **work** I have **completed** during my time at **University** and my **personal projects**.

## A Little Bit About Me
<hr>

I am a recent **Graduate** with a **First Class Degree** in **BSc Computer Science (Game Engineering)** from **Newcastle University** attaining results between 70-80% for each year of the course.

I am looking for a role within the **Games Industry**, with the goal of becoming experienced in **programming** for games.

I also enjoy **web development** and know most aspects of web development needed to build and maintain a **secure feature packed website**.

I have recently gotten over a period of depression but have now regained my enthusiasm for programming, I am currently working on improving my portfolio and applying for suitable jobs.

## Current Projects ##

### Current ###
View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby/Watermarker), Photo Watermarker.

**Photo Watermarker**

This reads a folder of images and produces a duplicate of the image with a watermark on top of the users choosing.
The previous itteration of this programs' result is shown below in past projects.

I have decided to work on improving this as I would like to get back into my amateur photography hobby also.

### Future ###

**Simple Snake 2D**

This is based on the classic Nokia game Snake, I hope to add extra interesting features such as upgradeable snakes; with ranks after the basic implementation is solid. I also plan on making a map editor using text maps and random fruit spawn.

- [x] Classes I expect to use
- [ ] Implement a singular cube as snake
- [ ] Implement map and collision
- [ ] Implement fruit
- [ ] Implement growing snake
- [ ] ......

*Update:12/02/2020* Postponing to work on Watermarker.
