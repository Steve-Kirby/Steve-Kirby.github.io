    <h3>Assignment 1 - Tax Chart and Calculator</h3>
    <p>The First coursework we were tasked with in Java involved creating a Tax Calculator which then displayed a bar chart showing income and amount to pay.</p>

	```java
		  
		 
	public class TaxCalculator {

		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		}
	
		/**
		 * Calculates how much tax to pay given an income
		 * 
		 * @param income gross income before tax
		 * @return tax to be paid(rounded)
		 */

			double payable = 0;
			//declaring all the values for each tax band and the thresholds for each one.
			double taxFree = 0.0,taxBand1 = 0.1,taxBand2 = 0.2,taxBand3 = 0.4,taxBand4 = 0.6,taxBand5 = 1.2;
			int threshold1 = 100, threshold2 = 150, threshold3 = 200, threshold4 = 300, threshold5 = 400;
			//this while loop will continue until income has reached 0, the way I have chosen to work out the tax paid is using
			//the idea that starting at the income value, and decrementing by 1 whilst adding to the tax payable value
			//until the income has reached 0.
			while(income>0){
				//it seems most logical to start at the higher threshold as when each for loop finishes it can move straight
				//on to the next for loop.
