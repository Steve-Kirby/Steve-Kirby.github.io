		<h3>Poster</h3>
		<p>For my 3rd year dissertation I wanted to explore graphics within programming as id never quite grasped how to implement them.</p>
		<p>Tackling this topic enabled me to explore the belly of the beast, I utilised a codebase provided to us during the graphics module I was doing that year.</p>
		<p>This provided a framework in which to easily set up a window using OpenGL as well as a few other features, however understanding the codebase I had never used before made this slightly more difficult; albeit increasing my confidence in using anothers complex code.</p>
		<p>I enjoy games with wide open worlds that can be explored so decided i would generate random islands, this changed after discussion with my tutors.</p>
		<p> The biggest change was to incorperate climate change and rising sea levels, which are returning to the forefront of issues we face once again.</p>
		<p>I made the decision to use heightmaps of the UK rather then randomly generated islands, in hopes of making people aware that these are real issues, not just an interesting graphics demo.</p>

		<h3>Planning - Gantt Chart</h3>
		<p>In order to organise my dissertation I used a gantt chart which changed over time after discussions with tutors and ideas came to me.</p>

		<h3>The Result</h3>
		<p>This project was a challenging experience for me, however I managed to achieve what I had set out to do, albeit not as pretty as I would have liked.</p>
		<p>The image shows the erosion and the inundation of water upon the UK after the sea level had risen.</p>

		<h3>Data Analysis Graph</h3>
		<p>Another aspect of this dissertation I enjoyed was the data analysis of testing performance of the simulation with different detail or tesselation levels, amount of textures being rendered etc.</p>
		<p>This is just one example of the graphs I produced in Excel, this particular graph using the fps, x and y position of the 'camera' to see how much the render times/fps were effected by how much of the model was showing on the screen.</p>

		<h3>Assignment 1 - Space Scene</h3>
		<p>Using OpenGL to create a space scene which needed to incorporate the sun, stars, a planet and a spaceship (user controlled).</p>
		<p>I also added in a moving comet which randomly starts at a location in the distance and flys towards the player, when leaving the screen it starts somewhere randomly in the distance again.</p>

		<h3>Assignment 2 - Shaders</h3>
		<p>Using OpenGL and GLSL I was to create four requested effects on cubes, and come up with two of my own.</p>
		<p>The two that I came up with on my own were the shattering cube and the twisting smiley cube.</p>

		<h3>Moodboard, Fontboard, Storyboard and Business Case</h3>
		<p>This stage was designing and developing ideas for the app, once I had started the storyboard I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted the app to look like.</p>
		<p>I also kept track of any ideas or problems I came across for the app in a spreadsheet</p>

		<h3>Coding the App</h3>
		<p>In this stage we programmed our apps using Android Studio, i used Java for this rather then Kotlin.</p>
		<p>The embedded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm44R9TGu7s">Youtube video shows the app in action</a> with voice over explaining what I am doing on the app.</p>
		<p>I then wrote a reflective essay on my experience designing and programming the app, highlighting what went right and what went wrong, as well as what I had learnt from this assignment.</p>

		<h3>Godot - Exported to HTML</h3>
		<p>The screenshot shows the game in action, it isnt perfect and it was extremely ambitious for the time I had to work with along side looming deadlines for other modules and my dissertation, but more importantly I learned a lot about Godot and game development in general whilst making this prototype game.</p>

		<p>As part of our <em>Software Engineering - Group Project</em> module we were to design and develop an android app, this could be a variety of different options chosen by the university.</p>
		<p>We decided as a group to take on the Seaton Valley Council app, which could provide information to residents of the parish.</p>
		<p>The gif here shows the app in use, for this project I was lead programmer along with 2 other programmers and 2 testers, ensuring any code pushed using gitlab was functional and could integrate with previous code.</p>

<h3>Lift Simulator</h3>
<p>Using assembly language, we were tasked with controlling a lift.</p>
<p>We had a very limited amount of memory to work with.</p>
<p>This was the first time delving into a completely different type of programming, I had completed a few smaller tasks to help learn for this assignment including a traffic light control system.</p>
