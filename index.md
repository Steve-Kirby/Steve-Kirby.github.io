# Welcome!
Feel free to browse my portfolio and [github repository](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby), 

The links in the header link to work I have completed during my time at university and for personal projects.

I am still updating this portfolio so check back soon for any updates! (version 1.1)

## A Little Bit About Me

I am a recent **Graduate** with a **First Class Degree** in **BSc Computer Science(Game Engineering)** from **Newcastle University** attaining results between 70-80% for each year of the course.

I am looking for a role within the **games industry**, with the goal of becoming experienced in **programming** for games.

I also enjoy **web development** and know most aspects of web development needed to build and maintain a **secure feature packed website**.

I have recently gotten over a period of depression but have now regained my enthusiasm for programming, I am currently working on improving my portfolio and applying for suitable jobs(hopefully).

## Current Projects ##

### Current ###

View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby/Watermarker), Photo Watermarker.

**Photo Watermarker**

This reads a folder of images and produces a duplicate of the image with a watermark on top of the users choosing.
The previous itteration of this programs' result is shown below in past projects.

I have decided to work on improving this as I would like to get back into my amateur photography hobby also.

### Future ###

**Simple Snake 2D**

This is based on the classic nokia game Snake, i hope to add extra interesting features such as upgradeable snakes with ranks after the basic implementation is solid with maps of your own design using text maps and random fruit spawn.

- [ ] Implement a singular cube as snake
- [ ] Implement map and collision
- [ ] Implement fruit
- [ ] Implement growing snake
- [ ] ......

*Update:12/02/2020* Postponing to work on Watermarker.
