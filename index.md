## A Little Bit About Me

I am a **mature student** studying on a 3 year undergraduate course in **Computer Science(Game Eng)** at **Newcastle University** in my final year of study.

Looking to get into **programming within the games industry**.

Enjoy web development and know most aspects of it to build a fully working site of any type, from security and databases to design.

## Current Projects ##
View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby/Simple-Snake-2D) Simple Snake 2D.

**Simple Snake 2D**
This is based on the classic nokia game Snake, i hope to add extra interesting features such as upgradeable snakes with ranks after the basic implementation is solid with maps of your own design using text maps and random fruit spawn.

- [x] Create classes expected to be used
- [ ] Implement a singular cube as snake
- [ ] Implement map and collision
- [ ] Implement fruit
- [ ] Implement growing snake
- [ ] ......
## Past Projects ##
View my [past projects on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby) to see what i have worked on in the past.

**Team Project** - [download app for android(auto 4.9mb)](http://retrohub.co.uk/app.php) (*university*) 

App for local council called seaton valley (Java)

![Demo Video](/SeatonValleyDemo.gif)

Have a look at some of the code involved for [Seaton-Valley-Council-App](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby/Seaton-Valley-Council-App)

**Website** - [retrohub.co.uk](http://retrohub.co.uk) (*personal*)

retrohub.co.uk is a ecommerce site for selling retro video games such as N64 and PS1, 360 degree view of items photographed in 35 images(not recommended for 3g/4g mobile data viewing). 

**Photo Watermarker** - 

This program was made for a friend who was paying silly prices for a website to watermark her photography with a very simple overlay and needed to upload all her photos to the website. As i had needed one before this i had a half done program and adapted it to her needs.

Before

## Education and Learning ##
Any resources i have used to help me learn from and use as a reference in case i need to look over it again, including YouTube, Books, University/College and Websites such as Stack Overflow, GitHub and any others i see fit.
This will be in reverse chronilogical order with the most recent and relevent information at the top of the list.
