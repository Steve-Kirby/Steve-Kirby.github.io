# Welcome!
<hr>
Feel free to browse my [portfolio](/coursework1) and [github repository](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby).

The **links in the header** show the **work** I have **completed** during my time at **University** and my **personal projects**.

I am still updating this portfolio so check back soon for any updates! (version 1.3 : 11/03/2020)

## A Little Bit About Me
<hr>

I am a recent **Graduate** with a **First Class Degree** in **BSc Computer Science (Game Engineering)** from **Newcastle University** attaining results between 70-80% for each year of the course.

I am looking for a role encompassing **programming**, with the goal of becoming a more experienced software or games developer.

I also enjoy **web development** and know most aspects of web development needed to build and maintain a **secure feature packed website**.

I have recently gotten over a period of depression but have now regained my enthusiasm for programming, I am currently working on improving my portfolio and applying for suitable jobs.

## Current Projects ##
<hr>

### Current ###
View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby/Watermarker), Photo Watermarker.

**Photo Watermarker**

This reads a folder of images and produces a duplicate of the image with a watermark on top of the users choosing.
The previous itteration of this programs' result is shown below in past projects.

I have decided to work on improving this as I would like to get back into my amateur photography hobby also.

**Sudoku Solver**

I am implementing a simple sudoku solver, currently the solver works on most easy, medium and hard sudoku boards.

There is no recursive backtracking implemented yet, this is the next step for this project for boards where an educated guess is required, there is also another logical process which I need to implement, more to come.

**Photography Website**

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL. I am currently developing a website which I can use to showcase my photography. I am taking a more object oriented approach to building this website then my previous 2 websites which was almost entirely procedural.

### Future ###

**Simple Snake 2D**

This is based on the classic Nokia game Snake, I hope to add extra interesting features such as upgradeable snakes; with ranks after the basic implementation is solid. I also plan on making a map editor using text maps and random fruit spawn.

- [x] Classes I expect to use
- [ ] Implement a singular cube as snake
- [ ] Implement map and collision
- [ ] Implement fruit
- [ ] Implement growing snake
- [ ] ......

*Update:12/02/2020* Postponing to work on Watermarker.
*Update:18/03/2020* Been working on my portfolio, also working on Sudoku Solver and Photography website.
