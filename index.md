## A Little Bit About Me

I am a recent **Graduate** with a **First Class Degree** in **BSc Computer Science(Game Engineering)** from **Newcastle University** in June 2019, attaining between 70-80% each year of the course.

I am looking for a role within the **games industry**, with the goal of becoming experienced in **programming** for games.

I also enjoy **web development** and know most aspects of web development needed to build and maintain a **working and secure website**.

## Current Projects ##
View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby/Simple-Snake-2D) Simple Snake 2D.

**Simple Snake 2D**
This is based on the classic nokia game Snake, i hope to add extra interesting features such as upgradeable snakes with ranks after the basic implementation is solid with maps of your own design using text maps and random fruit spawn.

- [x] Create classes expected to be used
- [ ] Implement a singular cube as snake
- [ ] Implement map and collision
- [ ] Implement fruit
- [ ] Implement growing snake
- [ ] ......

*Update:12/02/2020* Postponing to work on Watermarker.

## Past Projects ##
View my [past projects on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby) to see what i have worked on in the past.

### Team Project - Seaton Valley App (*university*) ### 

App for local council called seaton valley (Java)

![Demo Video](/SeatonValleyDemo.gif)

Have a look at some of the code involved for [Seaton-Valley-Council-App](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby/Seaton-Valley-Council-App)

### Website - PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS - retrohub.co.uk (*personal*) ### 

retrohub.co.uk was an ecommerce site for selling retro video games such as N64 and PS1, each item had a 360 degree view photographed in 35 images using a lazy susan turntable. The website used bCrypt in order to store users passwords as safely as possible, users accounts showed their baskets(items in baskets were locked for 15 minutes to prevent 2 sales of the same item at once due to the unique nature of the items for sale), past orders and basic details. Payment details and addresses were not stored, as I had implemented paypal.

![Website](/Retrohub.JPG)

The website is no longer running, however there are a few captures obtained by internet archive service; wayback machine, [Archived Website Shown Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180324135316/http://retrohub.co.uk/)

Filtering works as this used JS to hide elements, Sorting and searching does not work however, as this used SQL queries.

The image below shows the responsive layout and the page with the 360 degree view, however this does not work on the archive.

### Website - Wordpress - freegram.co.uk (*personal*) ###

freegram.co.uk was a blog site/advertising site where users could sign up and also post their own posts if they were looking for a "freegrammer" to build something for them for free, such as a charities website or application, allowing programmers to boost their portfolios and do something good, and for charities to get work done for free.

I also used the site to advertise any charitable causes being supported by friends, sadly i dont have any images of this website and the archive doesnt have any snapshots.

### Photo Watermarker  ###

This program was made for a friend who was paying for a website to watermark her photography with a very simple overlay and required her to upload each photograph.

Before

After (Done in less then a second)

![after watermarking](/WatermarkedFolder.JPG)

Have a look here at the code for [Photo Watermarker](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby/Photo-Watermarker)

*Update:12/02/2020* Starting to work on improving this implementation.

## Education and Learning ##
Any resources i have used to help me learn from and use as a reference in case i need to look over it again, including YouTube, Books, University/College and Websites such as Stack Overflow, GitHub and any others i see fit.
This will be in reverse chronilogical order with the most recent and relevent information at the top of the list.
### Current Goals
  - Working through android game programming course on [gamecodeschool.com](http://gamecodeschool.com/courses/android-game-programming/)
  - Working on Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) on [freecodecamp.org](http://www.freecodecamp.org);
