		<h3>Poster</h3>
		<p>For my 3rd year dissertation I wanted to explore graphics within programming as I had never quite grasped how to implement them.</p>
		<p>Tackling this topic enabled me to explore the belly of the beast, I utilised a codebase provided to us during the graphics module I was doing that year.</p>
		<p>This provided a framework in which to easily set up a window using OpenGL as well as a few other features, however understanding the codebase I had never used before made this slightly more difficult; albeit increasing my confidence in using another programmers complex code.</p>

		<h3>Planning - Gantt Chart</h3>
		<p>In order to organise my dissertation I used a Gantt chart which changed over time as needed.</p>
		<p>I enjoy games with wide open worlds that can be explored, and naturally wanted to generate random islands to replicate this, this changed after discussion with my tutors.</p>
		<p> The biggest change was to incorperate climate change and rising sea levels, which are returning to the forefront of issues we face once again.</p>
		<p>I made the decision to use heightmaps of the UK rather then randomly generated islands, in hopes of making people aware that these are real issues, not just an interesting graphics demo.</p>

		<h3>The Result</h3>
		<p>This project was a challenging experience for me, however I managed to achieve what I had set out to do, albeit not as pretty as I would have liked.</p>
		<p>The image shows the erosion and the inundation of water upon the UK after the sea level had risen.</p>

		<h3>Data Analysis Graph</h3>
		<p>Another aspect of this dissertation I enjoyed was the data analysis of testing performance of the simulation with different detail or tesselation levels, amount of textures being rendered etc.</p>
		<p>This is just one example of the graphs I produced in Excel, this particular graph using the fps, x and y position of the 'camera' to see how much the render times/fps were effected by how much of the model was showing on the screen.</p>

		<h3>Assignment 1 - Space Scene</h3>
		<p>Using OpenGL to create a space scene which needed to incorporate the sun, stars, a planet and a spaceship (user controlled).</p>
		<p>I also added in a moving comet which randomly starts at a location in the distance and flys towards the player, when leaving the screen it starts somewhere randomly in the distance again.</p>

	  <h3>What 'off' earth is Space Chess?</h3>
	  <p>The task for this assignment was to create a simulation of a Rook , Bishop, and Queen on a board, these pieces could move any distance by teleportation within the board including non-integer values (unlike chess).</p>
	  <p>I learnt a lot about polymorphism and inheritance as well as collision detection of simple shapes within a 2d space.</p>
