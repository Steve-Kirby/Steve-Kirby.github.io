		<h3>Blog Categories</h3>
		<p>I Chose to layout the site as a Blog, which would enable users to post their own blogs, projects and news by setting the correct category they could be seperated and easily found</p>
		<p>The main categories include News, Blogs and Projects, this is because the site is primarily supposed to be aimed toward companies with little to no budget/charities who need programming jobs done in exchange for a programmer to gain experience and a reference to add to their portfolio</p>

		<h3>Editing of Plugins</h3>
		<p>The use of plugins make it very easy to knock up a website in a very short time with great functionality, however to get the very best out of wordpress, you need the ability to edit or modify plugins to your liking, i have done this here with limited success as it is a very manual process, by disincluding my own posts into the blogs by users, and likewise with only including my own blogs in the blogs by me section</p>
		<p>Blogs by users will only show other peoples blogs, Blogs by Freegram will only show the blogs posted by me</p>
		<p>I also replicated the behaviour of showing all posts whereby the picture for the post is showing beside the blurb as this was not a default option with the plugin i used.</p>

		<h3>Custom HTML Pages</h3>
		<p>Of course just because the website uses wordpress predominantly, there is no reason why not to use custom html pages, as such i have created a smoking calculator, and of course this portfolio will be on a custom page on this website</p>
