# Welcome!
Feel free to browse my portfolio and [github repository](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby)

I am still updating this portfolio so check back soon for any updates! (version 1.1)

## A Little Bit About Me

I am a recent **Graduate** with a **First Class Degree** in **BSc Computer Science(Game Engineering)** from **Newcastle University** attaining results between 70-80% for each year of the course.

I am looking for a role within the **games industry**, with the goal of becoming experienced in **programming** for games.

I also enjoy **web development** and know most aspects of web development needed to build and maintain a **secure feature packed website**.

I have recently gotten over a period of depression but have now regained my enthusiasm for programming, I am currently working on improving my portfolio and applying for suitable jobs(hopefully).

## Current Projects ##

### Current ###

View my [current project on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby/Watermarker), Photo Watermarker.

**Photo Watermarker**

This reads a folder of images and produces a duplicate of the image with a watermark on top of the users choosing.
The previous itteration of this programs' result is shown below in past projects.

I have decided to work on improving this as I would like to get back into my amateur photography hobby also.

### Future ###

**Simple Snake 2D**

This is based on the classic nokia game Snake, i hope to add extra interesting features such as upgradeable snakes with ranks after the basic implementation is solid with maps of your own design using text maps and random fruit spawn.

- [ ] Implement a singular cube as snake
- [ ] Implement map and collision
- [ ] Implement fruit
- [ ] Implement growing snake
- [ ] ......

*Update:12/02/2020* Postponing to work on Watermarker.

## Past Projects ##
View my [past projects on GitHub here](https://github.com/Steve-Kirby) to see what i have worked on in the past.

### Dissertation - Generation of Islands and Simulating Climate Change using OpenGL (*university*) ###

A [link to my dissertation](/Dissertation.pdf) is available to read online(.pdf).

For my 3rd year dissertation i wanted to explore graphics within programming as id never quite grasped how to implement them, by tackling this topic i was able to explore the belly of the beast, utilizing a codebase that was provided to us during a graphics module we were doing that year also.

I enjoy games with wide open worlds that can be explored so decided i would generate random islands, this changed after discussion with my tutors to incorperate climate change and rising sea levels, which are returning to the forefront of issues we face once again. I made the decision to use heightmaps of the UK rather then randomly generated islands, in hopes of making people aware that these are our issues, not just an interesting graphics demo.

![Dissertation Poster](/DissertationPoster.png)

Another aspect of this dissertation I enjoyed was the data analysis of testing performance of the simulation with different detail or tesselation levels, amount of textures being rendered etc.

Below is an example graph produced in Excel by using the fps, x and y position of the 'camera' to see if how much of the model was on the screen affected the render times/fps.

### Team Project - Seaton Valley App (*university*) ### 

App for local council called seaton valley (Java)

![Demo Video](/SeatonValleyDemo.gif)

Have a look at some of the code involved for [Seaton-Valley-Council-App](https://github.com/Steven-Kirby/Seaton-Valley-Council-App)

### Website - PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS - retrohub.co.uk (*personal*) ### 

The website is no longer running, however there are a few captures obtained by internet archive service; wayback machine, [Archived Website Shown Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180324135316/http://retrohub.co.uk/), Filtering works as this used JS to hide elements, Sorting and searching does not work however, as this used SQL queries.

Retrohub.co.uk was an ecommerce site for selling retro video games such as N64 and PS1, each item had a 360 degree view photographed in 35 images using a lazy susan turntable. The website used bCrypt in order to store users passwords as safely as possible, users accounts showed their baskets (items in baskets were locked for 15 minutes to prevent 2 sales of the same item at once due to the unique nature of the items for sale), past orders and basic details. Payment details and addresses were not stored as paypal was implemented.

![Website](/Retrohub.JPG)

In the picture above, the website shows a few php templates coming together using a database to populate the page with products, this allowed me to control the stock and information quickly and remove them from the list of available stock automatically if they sold for example.

The image below shows the responsive layout and the page with the 360 degree view, however this does not work on the archive.

![Website](/RetrohubMobile.JPG)

### Website - Wordpress - freegram.co.uk (*personal*) ###

freegram.co.uk was a blog site/advertising site where users could sign up and also post their own posts if they were looking for a "freegrammer" to build something for them for free, such as a charities website or application, allowing programmers to boost their portfolios and do something good, and for charities to get work done for free.

I also used the site to advertise any charitable causes being supported by friends.

### Website - PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS - sellcards.co.uk (*personal*) ###

Much like retrohub.co.uk, this was an ecommerce site for pok√©mon cards and is also not a working domain anymore.

The images below show the layout of searching for cards, i have laid out like this as it seemed appropriate for a deck of cards, the user can hover over a card and it will enlarge and slowly transition to a dark background.

<p float="left">
  <img src="/SellcardsHome.PNG" width="auto" height="300px"/>
  <img src="/SellcardsHighlight.PNG" width="auto" height ="300px"/> 
</p>
Searching and sorting used SQL

![Search](/SellcardsSearch.PNG) 

Working baskets and itemised paypal checkout, paypal prerolled buttons were not appropriate for the amount of available cards, but i was able to roll my own.

### Photo Watermarker  ###

This program was made for a friend who was paying for a website to watermark her photography with a very simple overlay and required her to upload each photograph.

Before

After (Done in less then a second)

![after watermarking](/WatermarkedFolder.JPG)

*Update:12/02/2020* Starting to work on improving this implementation.

## Education and Learning ##
Any resources i have used to help me learn from and use as a reference in case i need to look over it again, including YouTube, Books, University/College and Websites such as Stack Overflow, GitHub and any others i see fit.
This will be in reverse chronilogical order with the most recent and relevent information at the top of the list.
