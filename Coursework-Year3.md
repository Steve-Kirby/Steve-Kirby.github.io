		<h3>Poster</h3>
		<p>For my 3rd year dissertation I wanted to explore graphics within programming as I had never quite grasped how to implement them.</p>
		<p>Tackling this topic enabled me to explore the belly of the beast, I utilised a codebase provided to us during the graphics module I was doing that year.</p>
		<p>This provided a framework in which to easily set up a window using OpenGL as well as a few other features, however understanding the codebase I had never used before made this slightly more difficult; albeit increasing my confidence in using another programmers complex code.</p>

		<h3>Planning - Gantt Chart</h3>
		<p>In order to organise my dissertation I used a Gantt chart which changed over time as needed.</p>
		<p>I enjoy games with wide open worlds that can be explored, and naturally wanted to generate random islands to replicate this, this changed after discussion with my tutors.</p>
		<p> The biggest change was to incorperate climate change and rising sea levels, which are returning to the forefront of issues we face once again.</p>
		<p>I made the decision to use heightmaps of the UK rather then randomly generated islands, in hopes of making people aware that these are real issues, not just an interesting graphics demo.</p>

		<h3>The Result</h3>
		<p>This project was a challenging experience for me, however I managed to achieve what I had set out to do, albeit not as pretty as I would have liked.</p>
		<p>The image shows the erosion and the inundation of water upon the UK after the sea level had risen.</p>

		<h3>Data Analysis Graph</h3>
		<p>Another aspect of this dissertation I enjoyed was the data analysis of testing performance of the simulation with different detail or tesselation levels, amount of textures being rendered etc.</p>
		<p>This is just one example of the graphs I produced in Excel, this particular graph using the fps, x and y position of the 'camera' to see how much the render times/fps were effected by how much of the model was showing on the screen.</p>

<h3>Assignment 1 - Polynomials and Quadratics</h3>
<p>For this assignment we were to display the co-efficient of a power of x, compute values of a polynomials given a value of x.</p>
<p>Overloading of +, * and - operators as well as IO operators >> and <<. Implemented other operators such as == != += -= *=, Constructors, Destructors, Assignment and Copy constructor; to allow manipulation of polynomials.</p>
<p>STL vector use was forbidden, requiring data to be stored on the heap using an array.</p>

    <h3>Part 1 - Newtonian Dynamics, Collision Detection and Resolution</h3>
	  <p>The game and framework was provided to us unfinished without any physics or AI, this is what we had to implement.</p>
	  <p>This part of the coursework involved detecting whether a collision had occured between AABB boxes and Spheres or a combination of. This was then to be improved using broad phase and narrow phase, I managed to implement a way of narrowing down the amount of collison calculations but would not class it as broad and narrow phase exactly; this is shown by the white squares in the image to the left.</p>
	  <p>The movement of player and enemy entities used newtonian dynamics with velocity, elasticity and mass affecting how impulses were resolved in the case of a collision. I implemented this quite well however shooting of the laser didnt work as well as i had hoped and was colliding in odd ways, leading to a very slow laser facing in odd directions, eventually I had to abandon this in order to work on other aspects of the coursework.</p>

    <h3>Part 2 - AI(State/Decisions), Flocking, Pathfinding, Entity Lifetime and Gameplay Rules</h3>  		<p>For this section, I implemented a basic boids flocking system , where the red, pink and green robots(non enemies) once close enough would flock together and stay together moving as a group without moving as one block.</p>
	  <p>I also implemented some basic State system for AI, where in the enemy robots chased the player if the player was close by, and stopped when they were not and moved randomly instead, I also had other states such as guarding and shooting half completed however ran out of time for this coursework due to other deadlines.</p>
	  <p>I was also was unable to implement A* pathfinding into the codebase, however I would like to learn this so will try to create a demo of my own in the future.</p>

		<h3>Assignment 1 & 2 - Make a game</h3>
		<p>The screenshot shows the game in action, it isn't perfect and was extremely ambitious for the time I had, alongside looming deadlines for other modules and my dissertation. More importantly I learned a lot about Godot and game development in general whilst making this prototype game.</p>
		<p>We could use any language and/or game engine we wanted to create the game, I chose Godot due to it being free and had heard good things about it when researching a game engine to use.</p>
